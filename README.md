# prolog-react-simulation
Test App to simulate coding challenges 

This is additional code that I added to the profy app simulation environment, https://github.com/profydev/prolog-app, to create a responsive side-bar menu 
for mobile to tablet screen sizes. 

Code is not functional unless imported into the profy development environment. Can be found and pulled from the above link.
